### Scope and Process of the Project
<hr>

The scope of the project consists of user login page, user registration page, home page, product detail page, product purchasing and bidding my account page and product adding pages.

I met with Next.js 2 weeks ago and thought it would gain experience to build the project with a structure I just learned. Of course, I faced many problems because I had no experience.
Because I like to research, I started to solve the problems I encountered, albeit slowly.
In this process so far
It consists of homepage, product detail page, login page and registration page. I will add purchasing and bidding notifications to the detail page. I will add product add page and add my account page. I will continue to develop these pages.
